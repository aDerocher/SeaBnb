### Overview

Seabnb is a travel website that enables users to make reservations on the worlds most beautiful, privately owned yachts. Once they have completed their stay, users can review how much they enjoyed the spot, and book it again if they like.

### Using Hurton
SeaBnb style and use are very similar to Airbnb. The look and feel should be immediately familiar to anyone who has used the latter. You can browse the splash page to see some possible locations, or check the reservation possibilities using the 'Im Flexible' button that is front and center.
